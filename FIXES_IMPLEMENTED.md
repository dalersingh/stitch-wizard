# Stitch Wizard — Fixes Implemented & Test Infrastructure  
*(PR #4 / branch `droid/fix-coderabbit-comments`)*  

## 1 · Summary of CodeRabbitAI Fixes  
| # | Issue reported | Resolution |
|---|----------------|------------|
| 1 | **Inconsistent `stepIndex()` usage** caused off-by-one progress & brittle look-ups. | All direct array look-ups replaced by the `stepIndex()` helper in `WizardController.php`. |
| 2 | **Progress bar never reached 100 %** on final step due to `floor()`. | Re-implemented as `round(($stepIndex / $totalSteps) * 100)` ensuring a final value of *exactly* 100. |
| 3 | **Empty sections rendered** when field groups contained no visible fields. | `resolveStepStructure()` now filters with `if (!empty($fields))`, preventing blank `<h2>` headings. |
| 4 | **Blade duplication** between step templates. | Introduced `resources/views/wizard/field.blade.php` partial; `step.blade.php` now uses `@include` for DRY markup. |
| 5 | **Invalid PHPStan param** (`checkMissingIterableValueType`). | Removed from `phpstan.neon.dist`; analysis now passes. |
| 6 | **Missing demo-app isolation**. | Added complete Dockerised Laravel demo that installs Stitch Wizard as a Composer path repository. |

## 2 · Test Infrastructure

### 2.1 Unit & Integration  
* Executed inside the *Laravel* container with `php artisan test --testsuite=Unit,Feature`.  
* Uses MySQL 8 & Redis services to mirror production stack for realistic coverage.

### 2.2 Playwright E2E  
Component | Purpose
----------|--------
`docker/demo/Dockerfile.playwright` | Slim Node 20 image with Playwright 1.40, browsers pre-downloaded, Xvfb for headless.
`e2e/tests/real-estate.spec.ts` | Canonical flow that completes the Real-Estate wizard end-to-end, exercising all fixes.
`e2e/playwright.config.js` | Configured to target `http://nginx`, capture screenshots, traces & HTML report.
Projects | `chromium` (default) plus dedicated `screenshots` project storing full-page PNGs to `test-results/screenshots/`.

### 2.3 Demo Laravel Environment  
File | Highlights
-----|-----------
`docker-compose.demo.yml` | Orchestrates `laravel` (PHP-FPM), `nginx`, `mysql`, `redis`, and `playwright` containers on `demo-network`.
`docker/demo/Dockerfile.laravel` | Multi-stage Alpine build; creates non-root **laravel** user; installs Composer & PHP ext.
`docker/demo/entrypoint.sh` | Idempotent: bootstrap fresh Laravel app, add *path* repo `/package`, `composer require dalersingh/stitch-wizard:@dev`, publish assets, run migrations & seeds.
Volumes | `demo-app`, `composer-cache`, `playwright-cache`, `test-results` — persist between runs for speed.

### 2.4 Helper Scripts  
Script | What it does
------|--------------
`run-demo-tests.sh` | One-stop CI entry: builds images (with cache), spins up stack, runs unit+E2E tests, collects artefacts, writes `test-results/summary.md`, optional cleanup.
`run-screenshot-capture.sh` | Lightweight variant to boot stack & execute only the E2E spec for fresh screenshots.

## 3 · Expected Results

1. **All PHPUnit suites pass** (Unit & Feature).  
2. **Playwright E2E** finishes with zero failures; artefacts saved to `test-results/`.
3. **Screenshots** (`01-initial-state.png … 08-final-100-percent.png`) demonstrate:  
   * Progress bar increments 0 %, 20 %, … 100 %.  
   * No blank section headings appear.  
   * Final completion page shows 100 % progress.  
4. **HTML Report** available at `test-results/html-report/index.html`.  
5. Build caches (Composer, NPM, browsers) stored in named volumes → subsequent runs start in **≤ 30 s**.

## 4 · How to Reproduce Locally

```bash
# one-time (or --build to force) 
./run-demo-tests.sh          # full unit + E2E suite
./run-screenshot-capture.sh  # quick screenshot-only flow
```

Screenshots & reports will be written to `test-results/`.

✅ These changes fully address CodeRabbitAI feedback, add deterministic CI-ready tests, and provide visual proof that Stitch Wizard behaves correctly in a real Laravel application.
